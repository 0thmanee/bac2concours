## 🔐 Authentication Architecture

### Core Components

1. **NextAuth v5** - JWT-based authentication with database validation
2. **Prisma ORM** - Type-safe database operations
3. **BCrypt** - Password hashing (cost factor 10)
4. **Zod** - Runtime validation schemas
5. **Database-Validated Sessions** - Prevents JWT replay attacks

### Security Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 1: Middleware (middleware.ts)                         │
│ - Checks for session token existence                        │
│ - Redirects to login if missing                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 2: Layout Protection (requireAuth/requireRole)        │
│ - Validates JWT signature                                   │
│ - Checks user exists in database                            │
│ - Validates email is verified                               │
│ - Validates role matches required role                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 3: API Route Protection (requireApiAuth/requireApiRole)│
│ - Same as Layer 2 but returns JSON errors                   │
│ - Uses ApiAuthError class for structured responses          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 4: Business Logic (Services)                          │
│ - Additional validation in service methods                  │
│ - Database constraints                                      │

## 👤 User Registration Flow

### Process Flow

```
User submits registration form
        ↓
POST /api/auth/register
        ↓
Validate with registerSchema (Zod)
        ↓
Check if email exists
        ↓
Hash password (BCrypt, cost 10)
        ↓
Determine role:
  - First user? → ADMIN (ACTIVE, emailVerified = now)
  - Other users? → FOUNDER (INACTIVE, emailVerified = null)
        ↓
Create user in database
        ↓
If FOUNDER:
  - Generate verification token
  - Send verification email (async, non-blocking)
  - Notify admins (async)
        ↓
Return success response
```

### Validation Rules (registerSchema)

- **Name:** 2-100 characters
- **Email:** Valid email format, max 255 chars
- **Password:** 
  - 8-128 characters
  - At least 1 uppercase letter
  - At least 1 lowercase letter
  - At least 1 number

## 🔑 User Login Flow

### Process Flow

```
User submits login form
        ↓
POST /api/auth/signin (NextAuth)
        ↓
Validate with loginSchema (Zod)
        ↓
Find user by email
        ↓
Compare password (BCrypt)
        ↓
Check emailVerified:
  - If null → throw "EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED"
  - If valid → continue
        ↓
Create JWT session
        ↓
Set session cookies:
  - authjs.session-token (dev)
  - __Secure-authjs.session-token (prod)
        ↓
Redirect to home (/)
        ↓
Home page redirects to role-specific dashboard

## 📧 Email Verification Flow

### Process Flow

```
User clicks verification link in email
        ↓
GET /verify-email?token={token}
        ↓
POST /api/auth/verify-email
        ↓
Validate token with verifyEmailRequestSchema
        ↓
Find token in database

## 💳 Payment Verification Flow (Founders Only)

### Complete Founder Journey

```
1. REGISTRATION
   ↓
2. EMAIL VERIFICATION
   ↓
3. LOGIN → Redirect to /founder (triggers founder layout)
   ↓
4. FOUNDER LAYOUT CHECK → Payment NOT_SUBMITTED
   ↓
5. REDIRECT TO /founder/payment
   ↓
6. USER UPLOADS PAYMENT PROOF
   ↓
7. Status = PENDING → Show "waiting for approval" page
   ↓
8. ADMIN REVIEWS PAYMENT
   ↓
9a. APPROVED:
    - User.status = ACTIVE
    - Email sent with approval notification
    - User can access /founder (dashboard)
    ↓
9b. REJECTED:
    - paymentRejectionReason stored
    - Email sent with rejection reason
    - Redirect to /founder/payment-rejected
    - User can resubmit
```

### Payment Status Flow

```
NOT_SUBMITTED → Upload form shown
      ↓
   PENDING → Waiting page shown
      ↓
   ┌──────┴──────┐
   ↓             ↓
APPROVED     REJECTED
   ↓             ↓
Dashboard    Rejection page → Can resubmit
```

### Layout Protection Strategy

- **`/founder/layout.tsx`**: Base founder authentication (requireFounder)
- **`/founder/payment/layout.tsx`**: Allows NOT_SUBMITTED, PENDING, REJECTED
- **`/founder/payment-rejected/layout.tsx`**: Only allows REJECTED status
- **`/founder/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`**: Only allows APPROVED status

### Payment API Routes

| Route | Method | Role | Description |
|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/api/payments/upload` | POST | Founder | Upload payment proof file |
| `/api/payments/status` | GET | Any Auth | Get current user's payment status |
| `/api/payments/pending` | GET | Admin | Get all pending payments |
| `/api/payments/[userId]/review` | POST | Admin | Approve/reject payment |

### Files Involved

- [app/founder/payment/page.tsx](app/founder/payment/page.tsx) - Upload form
- [app/founder/payment-rejected/page.tsx](app/founder/payment-rejected/page.tsx) - Rejection notice
- [app/admin/payments/page.tsx](app/admin/payments/page.tsx) - Admin review interface
- [app/api/payments/upload/route.ts](app/api/payments/upload/route.ts) - Upload endpoint
- [app/api/payments/[userId]/review/route.ts](app/api/payments/[userId]/review/route.ts) - Review endpoint
- [lib/services/payment.service.ts](lib/services/payment.service.ts) - Payment business logic
- [lib/email.ts](lib/email.ts) - Approval/rejection emails

## 🛡️ Protection Mechanisms

### Server-Side Helpers (lib/auth-security.ts)

#### For Layouts (Server Components)

```typescript
requireAuth() → User
// - Validates session exists
// - Checks user in database
// - Validates email verified
// - Returns user or redirects to login

requireAdmin() → User
// - All checks from requireAuth()
// - Validates role === "ADMIN"
// - Returns admin user or redirects to forbidden

requireFounder() → User
// - All checks from requireAuth()
// - Validates role === "FOUNDER"
// - Returns founder user or redirects to forbidden
```

#### For API Routes

```typescript
validateApiSession() → User | null
// - Returns user if valid session
// - Returns null if no session (doesn't throw)

requireApiAuth() → User
// - Throws ApiAuthError(401) if not authenticated

requireApiAdmin() → User
// - Throws ApiAuthError(401) if not authenticated
// - Throws ApiAuthError(403) if not admin

requireApiFounder() → User
// - Throws ApiAuthError(401) if not authenticated
// - Throws ApiAuthError(403) if not founder
```

### Database Validation Benefits

✅ **Prevents JWT Replay Attacks**  
If a user is deleted/deactivated in the database, their old JWT tokens become invalid immediately.

✅ **Real-Time Role Changes**  
Role changes take effect immediately without requiring re-login.

✅ **Email Verification Enforcement**  
Users with unverified emails cannot bypass the check even with valid JWT.

## 📁 Type Safety & Validation

### Centralized Type Definitions

All types are defined in dedicated files, not inline in components:

- **`lib/types/payment.ts`**: Payment-related types
  - `PaymentStatusData`
  - `PendingPaymentUser`
  - `PaymentMetrics`
  - `PendingPaymentsData`
  - `PaymentUploadResult`
  - `PaymentReviewResult`
  
- **`lib/types/prisma.ts`**: Database types
  - `UserWithRelations`
  - `StartupWithRelations`
  - `ApiSuccessResponse<T>`
  - `ApiErrorResponse`

- **`lib/validations/auth.validation.ts`**: Auth schemas & types
  - `LoginInput`, `RegisterInput`
  - `ResetPasswordInput`, `ResetPasswordApiInput`
  - `ResendVerificationInput`, `VerifyEmailRequest`
  - Response types: `RegisterResponse`, `VerifyEmailResponse`

- **`lib/validations/payment.validation.ts`**: Payment schemas
  - `ReviewPaymentInput`
  - Zod schemas with type inference

### Validation Flow

```
User Input
    ↓
Client-Side Form Validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
    ↓
API Request
    ↓
Server-Side Validation (Zod schema.parse())
    ↓
Type-Safe Business Logic (TypeScript)
    ↓
Database (Prisma with type safety)
```

## 🔄 Redirect Strategy

### Route Protection Matrix

| Route Pattern | Public | Auth Required | Role Required | Payment Required |
|---------------|--------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| `/` | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| `/login` | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| `/register` | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| `/verify-email` | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| `/contact` | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| `/admin/*` | ❌ | ✅ | ADMIN | ❌ |
| `/founder` (dashboard) | ❌ | ✅ | FOUNDER | ✅ APPROVED |
| `/founder/payment` | ❌ | ✅ | FOUNDER | ❌ |
| `/founder/payment-rejected` | ❌ | ✅ | FOUNDER | Must be REJECTED |

### Redirect Rules

1. **Unauthenticated users** → `/login?callbackUrl={current}`
2. **Wrong role** → `/forbidden`
3. **Unverified email** → `/login?error=email_not_verified`
4. **Founder without payment** → `/founder/payment`
5. **Founder with rejected payment** → `/founder/payment-rejected`
6. **Founder with approved payment** → `/founder` (dashboard)
7. **Logged-in user on homepage** → Role-specific dashboard

### Example Flow: Rejected Founder Accessing Dashboard

```
User navigates to /founder
    ↓
Founder layout checks: requireFounder() ✅
    ↓
Check payment status: REJECTED
    ↓
Redirect to /founder/payment-rejected
    ↓
Payment-rejected layout validates status is REJECTED ✅
    ↓
Show rejection page with reason
    ↓
User clicks "Soumettre à nouveau"
    ↓
Redirect to /founder/payment
    ↓
Payment layout allows REJECTED status ✅
    ↓
User uploads new document
    ↓
Status changes to PENDING
    ↓
Same-page refresh shows waiting message
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed During Audit

### ✅ Fixed: Missing Password Schema Export
**Issue:** `ForgotPasswordInput` type referenced non-existent `forgotPasswordSchema`  
**Fix:** Removed unused type export  
**File:** [lib/validations/auth.validation.ts](lib/validations/auth.validation.ts)

### ✅ Fixed: Inline Types in Hooks
**Issue:** Payment types defined inline in `use-payment.ts`  
**Fix:** Moved all types to `lib/types/payment.ts`, hooks now import types  
**Files:** 
- [lib/types/payment.ts](lib/types/payment.ts) - Created
- [lib/hooks/use-payment.ts](lib/hooks/use-payment.ts) - Updated

### ✅ Fixed: Inconsistent Auth Checks in Payment Layouts
**Issue:** Payment layouts used `auth()` directly instead of `requireFounder()`  
**Fix:** Updated to use `requireFounder()` for database validation consistency  
**Files:**
- [app/founder/payment/layout.tsx](app/founder/payment/layout.tsx)
- [app/founder/payment-rejected/layout.tsx](app/founder/payment-rejected/layout.tsx)

### ✅ Fixed: Added Missing VerifyEmailRequest Type
**Issue:** No type export for verify email request schema  
**Fix:** Added `VerifyEmailRequest` type export  
**File:** [lib/validations/auth.validation.ts](lib/validations/auth.validation.ts)
